Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since the last engineer started this repo from scrach, maybe it's worth someone will document what it needed to install the system on a new machine?_
